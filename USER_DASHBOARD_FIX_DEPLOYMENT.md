# User Dashboard Stats Fix - Deployment Guide

## 🚨 Critical Issue Fixed
**Problem**: User dashboard showed 0 stats while flights appeared on homepage because `user_id` was not being properly set during flight submission.

## 🔧 Root Causes & Fixes

### 1. **Wrong Status Values** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Dashboard was looking for non-existent statuses (`'pending'`, `'rejected'`)
- **Fix**: Updated to correct statuses (`'requested'`, `'declined'`)
- **Files**: `src/pages/UserDashboard.tsx`

### 2. **Missing User ID Population** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Flight requests were created without `user_id` field populated
- **Fix**: Updated to use secure RPC function that automatically sets `user_id = auth.uid()`
- **Files**: 
  - `database-security-functions.sql` - Updated function
  - `src/services/flightService.ts` - Updated to use RPC function

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Database Changes
```sql
-- Run the updated database-security-functions.sql
-- This updates create_flight_request_safe to use auth.uid()
```

### Step 2: Deploy Code Changes
The following files have been updated and need to be deployed:
- `src/pages/UserDashboard.tsx` - Fixed status values and added debug logging
- `src/services/flightService.ts` - Updated to use secure RPC function
- `src/hooks/useFlights.ts` - Added user flights query invalidation
- `database-security-functions.sql` - Updated RPC function signature

### Step 3: Verify Fix
1. **Submit a new flight request** while authenticated
2. **Check user dashboard** - should show correct stats
3. **Verify console logs** (development mode) show:
   - User ID being passed to queries
   - Flight creation with proper user_id
   - User flights being fetched successfully

## 🔍 Debug Information

### Console Logs (Development Mode)
The following debug information will be logged:
- `UserDashboard Debug:` - User ID and flight data
- `getUserFlights called with userId:` - Query parameters
- `getUserFlights result:` - Query results
- `createFlightRequest called with data:` - Submission data
- `createFlightRequest result - flightId:` - Created flight ID
- `Created flight object:` - Complete flight object

### Expected Behavior After Fix
- ✅ User dashboard shows correct statistics
- ✅ New flight requests appear in user dashboard immediately
- ✅ Status filters work correctly (requested, underway, published, declined)
- ✅ User can only see their own flights (RLS enforced)

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Database Migration Required**: The `create_flight_request_safe` function signature changed
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing flights without `user_id` will not appear in user dashboard
3. **Security**: RPC function now automatically sets `user_id` from authenticated user context
4. **Performance**: Added query invalidation to refresh user dashboard after submissions

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Submit flight request while authenticated
- [ ] Verify flight appears in user dashboard
- [ ] Check statistics cards show correct counts
- [ ] Test status filtering (requested, underway, published, declined)
- [ ] Verify only user's own flights are shown
- [ ] Check console logs for debug information
- [ ] Test with multiple users to ensure isolation
